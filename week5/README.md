This text includes three sample prompts and their outputs measuring success:

You: An eraser and a pen cost $1.10 in total. The eraser costs $1.00 more than the pen. How much does the eraser cost?

Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.

Mistral: Let's denote the cost of the pen as x. According to the problem, the eraser costs x + $1.00. The total cost of both the pen and the eraser is $1.10. So, we can set up the following equation to solve for x:
x (pen cost) + (x + $1.00) (eraser cost) = $1.10 (total cost)
Combine like terms:
2x + $1.00 = $1.10
Subtract $1.00 from both sides:
2x = $0.10
Divide both sides by 2:
x = $0.05
So, the pen costs $0.05, and the eraser, costing $1.00 more, costs $1.05. This results in a total cost of $1.10 for the pen and the eraser.


You: 8659-4350=?
Just a sec...
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:2 for open-end generation.

Mistral: Subtracting the smaller number from the larger number, we get:
8659 - 4350 = 4309
So the difference between the two numbers is 4309.
