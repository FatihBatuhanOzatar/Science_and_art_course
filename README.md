# Science and Art Course Project

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build, test, and deploy a generative AI web application. The final app will feature two modes:
* **Chat Mode:** A chatbot powered by an open-source LLM.
* **Art Mode:** A text-to-image generator using models like Stable Diffusion.

## Core Technology Stack

This project is built entirely using free and open-source tools:
* **IDE:** Google Colab (Free GPU)
* **AI Libraries:** Hugging Face `transformers` & `diffusers`
* **Web UI:** Streamlit
* **Version Control:** GitHub
* **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces

## Project Structure

All work is organized into weekly folders as required by the course plan. Each folder contains the notebook, a specific README, and any output files for that week.
