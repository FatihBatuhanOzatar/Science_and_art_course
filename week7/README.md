# Week 7: Generative Art with Open Models

This directory contains the deliverables for the Week 7 assignment.

## Task Summary

The objective for this week was to explore Generative AI for visual arts using open-source "Text-to-Image" models.

This was accomplished using:
* **Hugging Face Diffusers:** To access and run state-of-the-art diffusion models.
* **Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL):** A powerful open model (`stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`) loaded via Google Colab.
* **Prompt Engineering:** Designing descriptive text prompts to control style, composition, and atmosphere.

## Deliverables

* **`Week7_Generative_Art.ipynb`:** The Colab notebook used to generate the images.
* **Generated Images:** Three sample outputs demonstrating different artistic styles and subjects.

## Generated Outputs

Below are the sample images generated by the model based on specific text prompts.

### 1. Style Transfer
**Prompt:** *"A futuristic city in oil painting style."*

### 2. Complex Composition & Atmosphere
**Prompt:** *"A derelict robot reclining against a wall, malfunctioning with visible sparks, semi-seated pose, industrial decay, chiaroscuro."*
