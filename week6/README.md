# Week 6: Streamlit Web Interface

This directory contains the deliverables for the Week 6 assignment.

## Task Summary

The objective for this week was to build a web-based user interface for the chatbot created in Week 5.

This was accomplished using:
* **Streamlit:** To build the front-end UI components.
* **`app.py`:** A Python script to load the Mistral-7B model (from Week 5) and connect it to the Streamlit UI.
* **`localtunnel`:** To deploy the app from Google Colab and make it publicly accessible.

## Deliverables

This folder contains:
* **`Week6_Streamlit_App.ipynb`:** The Colab notebook used to install all dependencies and launch the application.
* **`app.py`:** The main Python/Streamlit application source code.
* **Screenshots:** Proof of the running application (see below).

## Application Screenshots

Here are screenshots of the final, working application running via `localtunnel`.
